    "Erosion: Erosion is a morphological operation that is used to reduce the size of foreground objects (i.e., white pixels) in an image. It works by removing the pixels at the edges of the object, gradually eroding the object. Erosion is achieved by convolving the image with a small kernel (structuring element), which moves over the image and replaces each pixel with the minimum value in the neighborhood of that pixel. Erosion can be used to remove small objects and separate overlapping objects in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dilation: Dilation is a morphological operation that is used to increase the size of foreground objects in an image. It works by adding pixels to the edges of the object, gradually expanding the object. Dilation is achieved by convolving the image with a small kernel (structuring element), which moves over the image and replaces each pixel with the maximum value in the neighborhood of that pixel. Dilation can be used to fill small holes in an object and merge nearby objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Erosion and Dilation can be applied multiple times in succession to achieve a desired effect. The number of times these operations are applied is called the iteration. Additionally, different types of structuring elements can be used to achieve different effects. Some common structuring elements include rectangular, circular, and elliptical shapes.\n",
